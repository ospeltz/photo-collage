"# photo-collage" 

A tool for manually cropping many images rapidly, then using these photos to create a collage that resembles a photo of choice. resize_images.py runs a simple (crappy) gui that allows the user to click two points to crop an image into a square. create_collage.py breaks a photo into smaller components and approximates each with a photo from the cropped images
